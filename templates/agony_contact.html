<div>AGONy was created by luksi02 (me, the author :D) as a fun project to increase my skills with Python and Django framework. Hope you liked it!
  <br>
  AGONy is still in build, it's still only a little seed that perhaps one day will grow into full-grown and enjoyable game!
  <br>

  if you have any idea how to improve my game/project, or just happened to enjoy it and have had some fun, be sure to leave comment!
